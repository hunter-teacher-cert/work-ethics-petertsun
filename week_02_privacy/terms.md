# Terms and Conditions of Dropbox and Google Privacy Policy

**Dropbox**  
The data collected by Dropbox includes account information and the documents saved on the platform. Users may also share contact information with the service.  In addition, Dropbox collects data on the usage of their services, such as the actions taken on the user’s account.  They also collect information on the device used, the IP address, and the type of browser.  Their technology also uses cookies and pixel tags to do things like remember the user’s  username.  Users of the free service occasionally receive information about account upgrades.

Somewhat mysteriously, in addition to the personal data mentioned above,  the policy also refers to collecting  and using “personal data for our legitimate business needs”.  It’s unclear what this means.

Dropbox shares this data  with other divisions of the firm and third parties that they contract with.  Some information (like the user’s name and profile picture) can be shared with other users.  If the user connects their Dropbox account with other services, some information will also be shared.  Dropbox may also be legally obligated to share data with law enforcement.  

**Google Drive**  
Google Drive collects information about their users, like their spoken language,
their names and passwords, payment information, contact information, and contents in
their google drives. Google's stated purpose for collecting information is to combat fraud, abuse, security risk, and programming bugs (technical issues). Google uses automation to comb through your information to detect spam, malware, and illegal content. It is great that Google
will collect information to fix programming bugs and security vulnerabilities in their
products.

Google allows users to export their content from their google drive to use elsewhere.
Users are also allowed to delete their content. The thing that bothers me is that
Google retains the right to keep copies of the data even if you already deleted your data.
The problem I find with this part of privacy policy is that a user's content is not
totally under the control of the individual anymore. If, for some reasons, Google deems
it necessary for its "legitimate" business to keep your content, there is nothing you
can do to prevent Google and Dropbox from keeping your content in the cloud.

Google drive has more interconnection with other Google services, while dropbox
is more dedicated to online data storage. With all their differences, both services
reserve the right to collect, store, and use personal information and content of
a user even if the user deleted content from the services. The big take-away from
the comparison and contrast of dropbox and google drive is that any content one
puts on these companies' servers is no longer solely controlled by the content's owner.
