# Deepfake Summary

Computer-generated imagery or CGI has been around since the 1970's.
However, with the advance of modern computing power, even an average computer
user can run free and open-source computer program on their home computer
to generate amazing computer-generated imagery. The capability of computer
hardware and software has advanced to a point where an image of one person
can be merged with a video of a different person to create a CGI video of
a realistic rendition of one person's face seamlessly integrated with
another person's body.

There are many advantages to having this CGI (deepfake) capability easily
accessible to consumers. Now people can use CGI to create exciting,
scary stunts by using a computer program, and make money by posting their
video contents on video sharing websites. Small budget film makers can
use CGI/deepfake to create comedic contents in their movies. This technology
can also allow ordinary people to superimpose their face on a clothing
model to try out the look of a new clothing without having to try the
new clothing in a dressing room.

There are also problems that come with easily accessible CGI/deepfake
technology. People can use CGI to create false audio confession to a crime
and send it to the police officers. This scenario is not far-fetched when
you examine cases of video gamers calling police/swat squad to raid another
video gamer's home by making false accusations. Also, people like LEO and
prosecutors with qualified immunity can use deepfake to prosecute and
convict innocent people since the court already decided that police
and prosecutors are legally allowed to lie. If they are authorized to
lie by the judges, it would actually be foolish for them not to make use
of a sanctioned powerful tool like deepfake to do their jobs.
